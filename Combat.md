beer style - turns off-balance-ness into a dodge around the enemy when attacked
duelist style - can do faster and faster attacks if remaining at 0-1 imbalance
acrobat style - can turn imbalance into movement that way

smash - if at 2 imbalance, can turn it into 2 the other way, and move the enemy a tile
charge - imbalance towards the enemy can increase damage
push - imbalance towards the enemy can push them
throw - if enemy is imbalanced towards you, you can duck and throw them
thrust - more damage if the enemy is imbalanced towards you, less if imbalanced away
spin - instead of a strong enemy imbalancing you, you can turn it into a spin for an extra damage counterattack. a spin would be purple balance, and youre temporarily more vulnerable for a half turn


some enemies can have a 50% dodge chance. if you're red and you miss, youll stumble and be stunned. (maybe not, i hate dodging enemies)


most enemies only know how to attack and run away, and dont really know that balance affects it negatively.


some enemies can hide their imbalance, if they wear cloaks or something.


if youre perfectly balanced, you can counter and do a lot more interesting moves that sacrifice balance.


perhaps you can sacrifice balance to reduce the damage or dodge? maybe it can be a setting for the player.


a slash one way will cause some imbalance one direction, a slash the other way will cause imbalance the other way. causes an alternating pattern.



could have just positive and negative. positive can mean "towards enemy" and negative can mean "away" and we can figure out the direction later depending on what enemy we're dealing with.
or, can have:
- red means toward enemy
- orange, toward and side
- yellow, side
- green, back and side
- blue, back


if youre balanced backward, you can dodge a lot easier.


a unit can specify a default balance. super aggressive fighters will go around with red balance. tricky technical attackers will be orange. defensive fighters will be green, cowards will be blue.
