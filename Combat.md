In the beginning, you don't have a balance problem, all the enemies are pretty lightweight.

Then, every time you attack, you give them +1 imbalance. When they reach +3, at the end of their turn they stumble a random direction and are stunned. Particularly good for on cliffs and ledges.

Then, later on, you come across an enemy human who can give you imbalance. Luckily, you can move to regain your balance. You learn to move backward to reset.

Later, you come across a swordsman that when at +3 can strike and move back (not in a random direction, and not stunned). It gets a little more interesting.

Then you learn about forward (red) and backward (blue) balance. When they attack you, it's random whether you'll get +1 forward, +1 backward, or +1 off-balance. You also learn that you can turn a +3 backward into a step at the end of your turn (like the swordsman) and turn a +3 forward into a power attack.

Later, you can actually influence what imbalance you have. You also get a few more abilities.

 * Can jump back at +3 backward at the end of their turn without being stunned.
 * Can turn a +3 forward into a push and attack
 * Can turn a +2 forward into a push
 * Can turn a +2 forward into a power attack
 * Can turn a +2 forward into +2 backward with a super power attack
 * More power when at 0 imbalance (critical hit basically).
 * Duelist: Can do two attacks when at 0-1 imbalance.
 * Acrobat: Can jump past the enemy at +3 forward.
 * Judo: Can turn an enemy's +2 off or +2 forward into a throw to move them to the other side of you and stun them.
 * Thrust: Can do more damage to an enemy that's +2 forward, and turn them into 0.
 * Instead of an enemy giving you imbalance, you can turn it into +1 spin (purple). +2 spin will increase your attack. You're a little more vulnerable when you have +1 spin.
 * +1 and +2 backward gives you less damage.

Later you learn about sideways balance. You no longer have off balance, just forward, backward, and sideways.

 * red means toward enemy
 * orange, toward and side
 * yellow, side
 * green, back and side
 * blue, back

You can use sideways balance with certain techniques:

 * Beer style: Turns off-balance-ness into a dodge around the enemy when attacked.

You also learn how to sacrifice balance on purpose.

 * Overwhelm: Turn 0 balance into +2 forward and do more damage.
 * Prepare: Can walk or defend and end up in a specified desired balance.

Some enemies start to hide their imbalance later, with cloaks and stuff.
